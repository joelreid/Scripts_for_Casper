# Scripts for Jamf

- Scripts for use on client Macs via Jamf Pro, variously appropriate:
    -in Configurations for Imaging
    -as Extension Attributes
    -in Policies, for Remote, via Self Service, etc
- Apologies, as most are in bash. This is just for maximum readability and maintainability by the largest portion of my coworkers, and because everyone knows some bash (and no-doubt has a favorite Real Programming Language™ different from the author).
